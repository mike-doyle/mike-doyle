Hey There! I'm a Computer Science Major currently enrolled at WGU, every project I post here are my own built from the ground up. 
My passion for programming stems from my love for video games and computer software. I've always had a knack for problem solving and finding
new and creative ways to envision solutions to everyday tasks, big and small. I always look for opportunities to learn and grow as I continue on my journey!
