#  🎮 Mike Doyle

Hey There! I'm am a CS Major currently enrolled at WGU. I like to code primarily in C# and C++
I am very much interested in learning how to program video games specifically but have a passion for 
anything to do with software or tech in general. WOW and Warcraft 3 are my favorite games! ⚔️ LOK'TAR OGAR! ⚔️
