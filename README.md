**`Software Engineer - Game Developer - Tech Enthusiast`**

Hey There! I'm a CS Major currently enrolled at WGU. I primarily code in C# and C++ but am open to learning all languages.
My passion for programming stems from my love for video games and computer software. I've always had a knack for problem solving and finding
new and creative ways to envision solutions to everyday tasks, big and small. I always look for opportunities to learn and grow as I continue on my journey!
